# World Time

A timeline comparision web application inspired by WorldTimeBuddy for my personal usage.
It allows user to compare time across multiple time zones. Long horizontal timeline interface that makes it easy to visualize past, present, and future times across different zones simultaneously. Built with Next.js for convenience.
